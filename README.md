☕ Coffee Shop Data Analysis Dashboard

📊 Overview

This project involves an in-depth analysis of coffee shop sales data, where I cleaned and transformed the raw data into a series of insightful visualizations. The dashboard provides a clear view of various metrics, helping to understand customer behavior, sales trends, and key performance indicators (KPIs).

🛠️ Data Preparation

Before diving into the analysis, the raw data required several preprocessing steps:

Data Cleaning:

Removed unnecessary or duplicate entries to ensure the data's accuracy.
Trimmed white spaces from columns to maintain consistency.


Date & Time Columns:

Extracted the Day of the Week and Month Name from the date column.
Created an Hour column from the time data to analyze sales patterns by time of day.

Size Column:
Extracted size-related information into a new column named Size with categories like Large, Regular, Small, and Not Defined.


📈 Analysis & Visualizations
The dashboard is built upon some pivot tables that were used to create various charts and slicers to highlight 

the key metrics:

Line Graph:

Tracks sales trends over time, allowing for a clear view of peak hours and sales fluctuations.

Pie Charts:

Visualize the distribution of sales by Size and Product Categories.

Column Graphs:

Compare sales across different Days of the Week, Product Types, and Time Periods.

Slicers:

Enable interactive filtering by various dimensions such as Day of the Week, Product Size, and Time Periods, making the dashboard adaptable to specific queries.


🛠️ Tools Used
Excel: For data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.

Pivot Tables & Slicers: To dynamically filter and analyze data.

Graphs: To represent data visually, including line, pie, and column charts.
